-> 🍙 **NOTE** : i will **not** accept random fq's, but if we've talked long enough and you think we should be friends, **hmu.**　﹒ 　︵︵　　𓏵 <-

-> i will **only** talk about my interests if you ask. **i don't open up** to people quite easily, and it'll take me a while to be actually comfortable with you　 𓈒　𓈒
**DO NOT** flirt with me or use pet names on me, even if it is a joke. i will immediately hide you. i only allow _my partner_ for such. <-
